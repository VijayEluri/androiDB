=AndroiDB
A Lightweight Database Library for Android.

==Installation
Fetch the code and import it as Eclipse project. Than include it in your own Android project (Project Properties -> Java Build Path -> Projects -> Add...).
A user-friendly jar in two versions (dex compiled and sun-java compatible) is planned for the first release.

==Usage
===Define Table Structure
Just extend your class from <tt>Table</tt> and set a DB version on it:

 @TableMetaData(version = 1)
 public class Category extends Table {
 
 	@Column
 	private String name;
 
 	@Column(notNull = true)
 	private int budget;
 
 	public Category(final Context context) {
 		super(context);
 	}
 	
 	//and some getters&setters
 }
With the <tt>@Column</tt>-Annotation you define a column in the DB. You don't need to define a Primary Key. 
This is alreade done by Table's "_id" Column.

===Enjoy
Now, you can call all CRUD-Method on Category:
 Table cat = new Category(getContext());
 cat.setBudget(42);
 cat.save();

 Table cat = new Category(getContext());
 cat.find(42);
 cat.setName("foo");
 cat.save();
 
 cat.delete();

===Versioning
When creating a table instance, this table will immidiatly created in the DB (when it's not existing, yet). Afterwards,
we will look in our Metadata-table to compare the current table version with the new created one. When they differ,
<tt>onUpgrade(int fromVersion, int toVersion)</tt> will be called. The default behaviour is to drop the current table, but
you can simply override the method to provide your own upgrade handling.

==Caution
Don't use SQL reserved words as column names! I could quote all column names, but SQLite don't behave like expected:
 sqlite> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Metadata ( '_id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 'table' TEXT NOT NULL);
 sqlite> insert into metadata ('table') values ('fjdksla');
 sqlite> select * from metadata;
 1|fjdksla
 sqlite> select table from metadata;
 Error: near "table": syntax error
 sqlite> select 'table' from metadata;
 table
